                WHO ARE WE?
            </h4>
            <p class = 'left'> Well, to sum everything up, we are four broke
                college students with the IQ level of 500, who are trying to earn money by selling... "plants". <br>
                The geniuses in this group is Sailendran, Darrel, Zaireen and Abdul. We created this online shop with our blood, sweat and tears.  Let's get to know the website more.

                WEBSITE FEATURES
            </h4>
            <p class = 'heading-s'> What makes our website so special? Here's a list of the features we have: <br>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class='list'> Login and Signup page </li>
                <li class='list'> Dynamic display for products </li>
                <li class='list'> Dynamic page for each product </li>
                <li class='list'> A fake payment page </li>
                <li class='list'> A cart system </li>
                <li class='list'> Authorized access for users and admin </li>
            </ol>
            <p> 
                
            &emsp;&emsp; As you can see, we have a fully functional login and signup page where you can create an account and also sign in to access your cart! <br>
            The cart system is protected, therefore no one can see what you're planning to buy *wink*... SO don't worry, your secret is safe with us, you weirdo. 
            <br><br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp; Dynamic pages are also created for you to view the different products that we offer! It's kinda cool. It means that the website is infinitely scalable! 
            The root <br>user can add new items at any time and even drop new images into the product-images folder so that each item can have a unique image. If it doesn't,
            the website provides <br>a fallback! =D
